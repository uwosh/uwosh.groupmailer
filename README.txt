Introduction
============
uwosh.groupmailer is a Plone 3.x product that allows users to send an
email to a whole group of users at once. It supports using documents
as 'form letters' so that commonly sent emails need be written only once.

It will add a new document_action called "Send as email to groups"
that will appear on all documents if the user has the Manager or
GroupMailer role.

That action will allow you to set the from email address, recipient
groups, a comma seperated list of other recipients, message subject,
and message body.

This product was built using mostly Zope3 technologies and is the first
major product that I have built using only zope.formlib.
